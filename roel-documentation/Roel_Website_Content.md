## About / Our Story Page

### Host Story

**Meet Ledia, Your Host**

[Professional portrait photo of Ledia]

[Ledia's personal story in her own words or a warm third-person narrative. This section should be 300–500 words and cover: How she came to Malta / the Three Cities. What inspired her to open Roel. Her philosophy of hospitality — what it means to her to welcome guests. A personal detail or two that makes her human and relatable (a favourite local dish, a morning ritual, why she loves the Three Cities). End with something inviting — "I look forward to welcoming you to Roel and sharing my favourite corners of Malta with you."]

### The Property

**A Story Written in Stone**

Roel Boutique B&B is housed in a [describe the building: age, original purpose, architectural style]. Like much of Malta's built heritage, its walls are carved from globigerina limestone — the same honey-gold stone that gives the entire island its warm, luminous character.

[Describe the restoration: how the property was transformed from its original use into a boutique B&B. What was preserved (original features) and what was modernised. Any interesting historical details or discoveries during restoration.]

Today, Roel offers [number] rooms, each with its own personality, along with [common areas: terrace, breakfast room, lounge]. The name "Roel" [explain the meaning or origin of the name if there's a story behind it].

### What Makes Roel Different

**Personal, not transactional.** At Roel, you'll never feel like a room number. Ledia greets every guest personally, knows your name, remembers your preferences, and genuinely cares that you have the best possible time in Malta.

**Heritage with heart.** This isn't a corporate hotel styled to look old. It's a real heritage building that has been part of the Three Cities for centuries, restored with love and filled with authentic character.

**Recognised excellence.** Our 9.9/10 rating on Booking.com places Roel among Malta's highest-rated accommodations. But we don't chase scores — we focus on making every guest feel genuinely welcome, and the ratings follow.

**The Three Cities advantage.** While Valletta fills with day-trippers, the Three Cities offer the real Malta — quieter, more authentic, and deeply historic. A five-minute ferry ride connects you to the capital whenever you want it, but coming home to Roel's peaceful streets at the end of the day is its own reward.

## Location & Getting Here Page

### Introduction

**In the Heart of the Three Cities**

Roel Boutique B&B sits in Cospicua (Bormla), one of Malta's Three Cities — a cluster of fortified towns on the Grand Harbour that predate Valletta and hold centuries of maritime history within their limestone walls. It's the side of Malta that most visitors never see, and the side that stays with you longest.

[Interactive Google Map embedded here, centred on the property]

### Key Distances

- Valletta ferry terminal: [X] min walk + 5 min crossing
- Malta International Airport: ~20 min by car / taxi
- Birgu (Vittoriosa): [X] min walk
- Senglea (Isla): [X] min walk
- Fort St Angelo: [X] min walk
- Cottonera Marina: [X] min walk

### Getting Here

**From Malta International Airport:** The easiest option is a taxi or pre-booked transfer (approximately EUR 20–25, 20 minutes). We're happy to arrange a transfer for you — just let us know your flight details. Alternatively, bus routes [X] and [X] connect the airport to the Three Cities area (approximately [X] minutes, EUR [X] per ride).

**From Valletta:** Take the traditional dgħajsa water taxi or the regular ferry from Valletta's Grand Harbour waterfront to the Three Cities. It's a scenic five-minute crossing with stunning views of the fortifications. From the ferry landing, Roel is a [X]-minute walk.

**By car:** If you're driving, our address is [full address]. [Describe the nearest parking options clearly and specifically, as parking in historic areas is a common guest concern.] We recommend [specific parking area or arrangement]. Free street parking is available [where] though spaces can be limited during [times].

### Why the Three Cities?

The Three Cities — Cospicua, Birgu, and Senglea — are where Malta's story began, centuries before Valletta was built. Knights of St John, Ottoman sieges, and WWII all left their mark here. Today, these fortified harbour towns are experiencing a quiet renaissance: waterfront restaurants, artisan workshops, and boutique accommodations are breathing new life into the ancient streets, yet the area remains blissfully free of mass tourism.

Staying here means waking up to authentic Malta — fishermen mending nets, locals chatting over morning coffee, church bells marking the hours — while Valletta's world-class museums, restaurants, and nightlife are just a ferry ride away. It's the best of both worlds.
